        <div className="space-y-6">
          <p>
            I don‚Äôt know what it is, but‚Ä¶
            <strong>
              no matter how many thoughts I chase, they all converge back to

            </strong>
            And honestly? That realization is giving me chills.
          </p>

          <p>
            I mean, think about it‚ÄîAI is only going to keep evolving. It‚Äôs
            heading toward a state of ‚Äúknowing everything.‚Äù That part‚Äôs
            inevitable.

          <p>
            But then the real question becomes:
            <strong>Can humans afford to just sit back and relax?</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            In order to make use of that knowledge,
            <strong>we need to know how to ask for it.</strong>
            Because‚Äî
            <em>you can‚Äôt ask about what you don‚Äôt know exists.</em>
          </p>

          <p>
            Which means, ironically,
            <strong>
              if we want AI to make life easier, we‚Äôll have to keep

          <p>
            <strong>
              What you ask of AI becomes a reflection of who you are.
