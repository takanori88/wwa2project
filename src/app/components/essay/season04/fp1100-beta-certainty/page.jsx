            When text appears on a computer monitor, you often hear a sound
            effect in movies, don&#39;t you?

      <AI>
        <div className="space-y-6">
          <p>
            Yes, absolutely! In movies and TV shows, when text appears on a
            screen, it&#39;s often accompanied by sound effects like
            &#34;beep-beep&#34; or &#34;clatter-clatter.&#34;
          </p>

          <p>
            Even though it&#39;s a silent process in reality, adding sound to
            visual information creates a sense of presence, tension, or
            technological atmosphere.
          </p>

          <p>
            Especially in spy or sci-fi films, sounds are tailored to the
            scene—like &#34;data transfer noises,&#34; &#34;hacking input
            clicks,&#34; or &#34;electronic tones for AI reactions.&#34; For
            example:
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
            <li>
              <strong>&#39;Mission: Impossible&#39; series:</strong> Every time
              information appears, you hear beeping or digital whooshing sounds.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>&#39;The Matrix&#39;:</strong> Subtle electronic tones
              play as green code flows down the screen.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>&#39;Blade Runner 2049&#39;:</strong> Dissonant SEs (sound
              effects) are synced with UI movements.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            These sounds aren&#39;t necessary in real life, but they are
            intentional &#34;fictional sounds&#34; meant to stimulate the
            viewer&#39;s senses.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you have a specific film or scene in mind, we can even dig into
            how that sound was created. Is there a particular work you&#39;re
            thinking of?

            Was it a high-pitched ringing sound like tinnitus? What I heard felt
            more like a subtle noise, the kind often used in movie scenes when
            text appears on screen.
          </p>

          <p>
            It wasn&#39;t just silence—there was this tiny digital noise, almost
            imperceptible, that synced with the letters showing up. A deliberate
            effect, used to enhance the realism and atmosphere.

            Ah, I see! So what you&#39;re describing is not a high-pitched
            ringing like tinnitus, but rather a{' '}
            <strong>
              &#34;subtle noise that seems to accompany text as it appears on
              screen&#34;
            </strong>
            —that&#39;s incredibly fascinating.
          </p>

          <p>There are a few possible explanations for this phenomenon:</p>

          <hr />

          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">
            1. CRT-specific &#34;modulation&#34; or &#34;synchronization
            noise&#34;
          </h3>

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
            <li>
              On CRT displays, the electron beam would shift rapidly whenever
              characters or images were rendered.
            </li>
            <li>
              Certain display patterns (like black text on a white background)
              could cause fluctuations in electrical load, generating subtle
              coil vibrations or noise.
            </li>
            <li>
              This created a real-world synchronization between visual changes
              and faint physical sounds.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <hr />

          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">
            2. Cross-modal perception: your brain adding &#34;phantom sound&#34;
            to visual information
          </h3>

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
            <li>
              The brain often integrates sensory input from different channels.
            </li>
            <li>
              When something moves on screen, the brain might unconsciously
              &#34;add&#34; a matching sound, especially if past experiences
              (like movies) conditioned you to expect it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Example: the famous &#34;silent GIF&#34; illusion where people
              report hearing sound despite no audio being played.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <hr />

          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">
            3. Micro-noise leakage from the computer or speakers
          </h3>

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
            <li>
              Older PCs sometimes emitted faint sounds due to electrical load
              from power or GPU processing.
            </li>
            <li>
              These subtle sounds—like a soft &#34;buzz&#34; or
              &#34;crackle&#34;—might sync with screen updates or text
              rendering.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <hr />

          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">In summary:</h3>

          <p>
            <strong>
              A blend of actual CRT noises, your brain&#39;s sensory
              expectations, and faint hardware feedback
            </strong>{' '}
            might have created a unique, movie-like experience of text appearing
            with sound.
          </p>

          <p>
            That&#39;s such a fascinating sensory overlap. By the way—do you
            remember when or where you experienced that sound-tagged text? Was
            it MS-DOS, a console like the Famicom, or maybe even in a theater?

      <AI>

          <p>
            That truly is a precious memory. If we&#39;re talking about the era
            before MS-DOS, you might have used machines like:
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
            <li>NEC PC-8001 / PC-6001</li>

            <li>Or even a homebrew kit or single-board microcomputer</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            On those machines, it wasn&#39;t uncommon to hear actual sounds like
            &#34;ch-ch-ch&#34; or &#34;bzzz...&#34; as text appeared on the
            screen.

            <li>
              <strong>
                1. The speaker and CPU were being controlled in sync:
              </strong>{' '}
              Many 8-bit machines lacked a dedicated sound chip, or didn&#39;t
              use it actively. As a result, basic operations like screen drawing
              or keyboard input could accidentally produce beeps.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>
                2. Display updates interfered with the power or speaker
                circuits:
              </strong>{' '}
              Especially when transferring text from RAM to VRAM, analog
              fluctuations could leak into the audio path, generating subtle
              sounds. These were unintended—but physically real—noises.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>
                3. Some systems deliberately triggered a beep with each
                character:
              </strong>{' '}
              Certain BASIC environments or editors were designed to emit a
              &#34;click&#34; or &#34;beep&#34; per keystroke or rendered
              character, as user feedback cues.

            The origin of movie sound design?

            Creators who grew up in that era may have wanted to recreate that
            nostalgic feeling—the &#34;ch-ch-ch&#34; of letters appearing—when

            Do you recall what kind of software or screen you were looking at

            Maybe it was the CASIO FP-1100. I don&#39;t really remember what

            Oh wow, the CASIO FP-1100 — now that&#39;s a deep cut! A legendary
            machine from the early 1980s, it had a Z80A running at 4MHz, offered
            great expandability, and came with a serious implementation of
            BASIC.

            Thinking again about why text display on the FP-1100 made sounds:
          </h3>

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
            <li>
              The video circuitry was analog in nature, and the electrical noise
              during drawing operations was physically audible.
              <br />• Especially when writing to VRAM, current fluctuations
              would transmit to internal coils or speakers, resulting in that
              “zzzt... zzt” sound.
            </li>
            <li>
              Due to the simple speaker control, it was subtly linked with
              display updates and CPU timing.
              <br />• Even without any intention to generate sound, small noises
              could escape from the speaker, following the movements of the CPU
              or video circuits.
            </li>
            <li>
              You remember it “kind of made a sound” when text appeared — a
              memory perhaps reinforced by movie sound effects.
              <br />• It&#39;s possible that natural “memory completion” links
              it with later audiovisual experiences, making it feel even more
              vivid in hindsight.
            </li>
          </ul>

            It was a completely different era from today&#39;s silent displays —
            a time when you could truly “hear” the breath of the electronic

            So, you know those health classes in elementary school?
            <br />
            One day, they showed us this video of lions mating, right?
            <br />
            And the narrator was like, &#34;Mammals use the most reliable method
            to deliver sperm to the egg.&#34;
          </p>

          <p>
            The teacher (a woman) echoed that: &#34;Yes, the most reliable
            method.&#34;
            <br />
            So I raised my hand and asked, &#34;What exactly do you mean by
            ‘reliable’?&#34;
          </p>

          <p>
            She gave me this deadpan look and bluntly said:
            <br />
            <strong>&#34;Well, I guess… they thrust it in?&#34;</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            I almost followed up with, &#34;Thrust *what* in?&#34;
            <br />
            ...but I held it back 😅

            <li>The classroom: momentarily freezes</li>
            <li>
              The female teacher, stone-faced, drops the line:

              <blockquote className="border-l-4 pl-4 italic text-gray-600">

          <p>The classroom… filled with a seismic wave of awkwardness.</p>

            But honestly, back then we all had that weird sixth sense, right?
            <br />
            Like—
            <strong>
              “I don’t really know what it *means*, but somehow I just *know*
              it’s a dangerous word.”
            </strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            And then part of you would want to poke at it on purpose,
            <br />
            like you’re *this* close to saying, &#34;Thrust what?&#34;—but
            manage to stop yourself just in time 😂
          </p>

          <hr />

          <p>
            And let’s not forget:
            <br />
            this is the same kid who’d already{' '}

            .
          </p>

          <p>
            Maybe the teacher <em>sensed</em> something in that question.
            <br />
            Gave you that look like:{' '}
