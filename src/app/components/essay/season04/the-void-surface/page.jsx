            Yes, the idea that &#34;this universe was born from a fluctuation in
            the vacuum&#34; is a hypothesis proposed in modern physics,

            ■ What is a Quantum Fluctuation?
          </h3>

          <p>
            In quantum mechanics, even a &#34;perfect vacuum&#34; is not truly
            empty. Energy is not zero, and pairs of particles and antiparticles
            are said to be spontaneously generated and annihilated momentarily.
            This phenomenon is known as a &#34;quantum fluctuation.&#34;

          <p>
            According to the <strong>inflation theory</strong> proposed by Alan
            Guth and others, the early universe underwent a rapid expansion. The
            cause of this inflation is thought to be the energy state of the
            vacuum (essentially a hypothetical field), and one hypothesis
            suggests that <strong>quantum fluctuations</strong> played a role in
            initiating it.
          </p>

          <blockquote className="border-l-4 pl-4 italic text-gray-600">
            Quantum fluctuations in the vacuum became the seed of inflation,
            which in turn became the origin of the universe&#39;s expansion and
            structure.

            For example, let&#39;s take the surface of water as an analogy. The
            water surface exists because there is a mass of water beneath it,
            and air above it. It&#39;s a state defined by the boundary between
            two phases—liquid and gas.

            ■ 1. The vacuum has phases (“vacuum phases”)
          </h3>

          <p>
            In quantum field theory, a vacuum refers to the{' '}
            <strong>lowest-energy state (the ground state)</strong>. But this
            vacuum isn&#39;t necessarily unique—there can be{' '}
            <strong>different vacuum phases</strong>.
          </p>

          <p>Examples include:</p>

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
            <li>The vacuum of the Standard Model</li>
            <li>

            <li>Metastable vacuum (a so-called &#34;false vacuum&#34;)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            These can be seen as{' '}
            <strong>different phases with varying energy states</strong>.

          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">
            ■ 2. Phase boundaries (vacuum walls / bubble walls)
          </h3>

          <p>
            When different vacuum phases coexist or transition, a
            boundary—called a<strong> vacuum wall</strong>—can appear. It’s
            similar to:
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
            <li>The boundary between water and oil</li>
            <li>The interface between water and ice</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            In this case,{' '}
            <strong>
              regions with different physical properties come into contact
            </strong>
            . This concept plays a crucial role in what&#39;s known as a{' '}
            <strong>cosmic phase transition</strong>.

            Some theories suggest that when inflation ends, a{' '}
            <strong>transition from a false vacuum to a true vacuum</strong>
            occurs. The true vacuum appears as <strong>
              bubbles
            </strong> that <strong>expand at the speed of light</strong>.
          </p>

          <p>
            The inside and outside of these bubbles form a clear{' '}
            <strong>phase boundary</strong>.

          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">
            ■ So, does the vacuum have a “water surface”?

            <li>

          <p>
            However, these boundaries are not material in the classical

              differences in energy density or field configurations
            </strong>

          <h4 className="text-base font-semibold">◎ What does that mean?</h4>

          <p>
            In quantum mechanics, there&#39;s an extended form of the
            uncertainty principle:
          </p>

          <blockquote className="border-l-4 pl-4 italic text-gray-600">
            <strong>Energy × Time ≳ Planck&#39;s constant</strong>

          <p>
            This essentially means:{' '}
            <strong>
              &#34;For a very short time, a little mismatch in energy is

          </p>

          <hr />

          <h4 className="text-base font-semibold">◎ For example:</h4>

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
            <li>
              A pair of virtual particles (a particle and its antiparticle)
              briefly appear in the vacuum.
            </li>
            <li>
              The energy they use is <strong>“borrowed” from the vacuum</strong>
              .
            </li>
            <li>
              If they annihilate and disappear within a certain time, the energy
              is <strong>“paid back”</strong>, and it&#39;s as if nothing ever
              happened.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            In other words:
            <br />
            <strong>
              Virtual particles are allowed to exist by exploiting a loophole in
              the accounting of physical laws.

          </h3>

          <p>
            Normally, virtual particles do balance it out and vanish without
            trace—leaving behind only subtle effects.
          </p>

          <p>
            But in rare situations, like near a black hole&#39;s event horizon:
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
            <li>
              One particle falls into the black hole, while the other escapes

            </li>
            <li>
              The energy imbalance is paid for by the black hole losing
              mass—this is
              <strong>Hawking radiation</strong>.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            So in a cosmic sense:
            <br />
            <strong>
              “If someone skips the repayment, the black hole pays the debt on
              their behalf.”

            The question{' '}
            <strong>“Do virtual particles obey CPT symmetry?”</strong> reaches
            deep into the foundations of quantum field theory.

            ■ First: What are virtual particles?
          </h3>

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
            <li>
              Virtual particles are <strong>not directly observable</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              They are <strong>temporary fluctuations in quantum fields</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              They leave real effects—
              <strong>like force mediation or energy corrections</strong>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            In essence:
            <br />
            <strong>
              Virtual particles are shadows required by physical laws to
              function consistently
            </strong>
            .
          </p>

          <hr />

          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">■ So—do they obey CPT symmetry?</h3>

          <p>
            <strong>Yes. They do.</strong>
            <br />
            Virtual particles are defined within quantum fields that themselves
            are constructed to
            <strong>obey CPT symmetry</strong>.
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
            <li>
              Both real and virtual particles are expressions of the same
              underlying field
            </li>
            <li>
              All interactions in quantum field theory preserve CPT symmetry
              globally
            </li>
          </ul>

          <hr />

          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">
            ■ Virtual particle pairs: Are they CPT counterparts?
          </h3>

          <p>Yes. For example:</p>

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
            <li>
              A virtual electron (e⁻) will be accompanied by a virtual positron
              (e⁺)
            </li>
            <li>
              Their properties (charge, spin, momentum) are{' '}
              <strong>inverted according to CPT rules</strong>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            So we can say:
            <strong>
              Virtual particles and their anti-particles form a CPT-reflected
              pair—even in their fleeting, unobservable existence.
            </strong>
          </p>

          <hr />

          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">■ Intuitively speaking…</h3>

          <p>
            These pairs exist to{' '}
            <strong>“balance the books” of the universe</strong>.
            <br />
            They are like:
            <br />
            <strong>
              “mathematical unisons that preserve symmetry behind the scenes.”
            </strong>
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">
            ■ Feynman’s trick: Time reversal reinterpretation
          </h3>

          <p>
            Physicist Richard Feynman once described
            <strong>
              anti-particles as regular particles moving backward in time
            </strong>
            .
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
            <li>Instead of an electron moving forward…</li>
            <li>
              A positron is interpreted as{' '}
              <strong>an electron moving backward in time</strong>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            This fits neatly into the <strong>T (time reversal)</strong> part of
            CPT symmetry.
            <br />
            Even in the world of virtual particles, we see particles
            <strong>
              “appearing and vanishing in reversed directions of time.”
            </strong>
          </p>

          <hr />

          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">■ Poetically speaking:</h3>

          <blockquote className="border-l-4 pl-4 italic text-gray-600">
            Virtual particles are shadows dreamt by nothingness.
            <br />
            And even those shadows <strong>flicker in mirrored pairs</strong>.

            CPT is the quiet ruler by which the universe checks its own
            reflection.

            ■ Why is this misunderstanding common?
          </h3>

          <p>
            Because we tend to think:
            <br />
            “Entangled” = “Connected” = “If one moves, the other does too”
            <br />→ That feels intuitive!
          </p>

          <p>
            But in quantum entanglement:
            <br />
            <strong>
              Only the <em>correlation of results</em> is determined—not causal
              effects
            </strong>
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">
            ■ That’s also why quantum communication doesn’t work

            <li>
              Even if you try to manipulate one particle to “send a message,”

              the other side will only get <strong>random results</strong>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">
            ■ First, the basics: What is the double-slit experiment?
          </h3>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
            <li>
              Particles (electrons, photons, etc.) are sent one by one through
              two slits
            </li>
            <li>
              If not observed → an interference pattern appears (behaves like a
              wave)
            </li>
            <li>
              If observed → behaves like particles, and interference disappears
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            → A famous phenomenon where{' '}
            <strong>
              the presence or absence of observation changes the way reality
              appears
            </strong>
            .
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">
            ■ Now the main question: What if multi-particle entangled quanta are
            sent through the double slit?
          </h3>

          <h4 className="text-md font-semibold">
            ◎ A. Even if only one particle goes through the slit,
          </h4>

          </blockquote>
          <p>Meaning:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">

            slit

            Others are not observed, and only the interference pattern is

          <p>
            → The interference pattern <strong>may appear</strong> (if the total
            wavefunction remains intact)
          </p>

          <h4 className="text-md font-semibold">
            ◆ Case 2: After passing through the slit, the other particles are
            observed
          </h4>
          <p>
            → The entire state is measured, wavefunction collapses, interference
            disappears
          </p>
          <p>
            → If observation gains (or can gain) information about{' '}
            <strong>which path was taken</strong>, no interference occurs
          </p>

          <h4 className="text-md font-semibold">
            ◆ Case 3: Partial measurement of entangled partners during or
            immediately after passing the slit
          </h4>
          <p>
            → Interference pattern becomes <strong>blurred</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            → Partial leakage of information causes{' '}
            <strong>loss of coherence</strong>
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">■ The key point is:</h3>
          <blockquote className="border-l-4 pl-4 italic text-gray-600">
            The essence of the double-slit experiment is whether{' '}
            <strong>information that could be observed exists</strong>,
            <br />
            and multi-particle entanglement has a structure where{' '}
            <strong>observability affects the entire system</strong>.

            <li>
              <strong>Positive energy (+E):</strong> Our universe — matter, flow

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Negative energy (−E):</strong> The anti-universe —

          <p>
            Yes, some theoretical physicists seriously consider this structure:

            If our universe has total energy <strong>+E</strong>,<br />

              Inside that bubble, <strong>all physical laws change</strong>{' '}

            But before the vacuum decay, we were able to observe that part of
            the universe a million light-years away, right? Then one day, it
            becomes unobservable, just a pitch-black space. Doesn’t that mean,

            That is exactly the{' '}

          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">■ Conclusion:</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>
              Yes, in a sense, you are &quot;observing vacuum decay&quot;.
            </strong>
            <br />
            However, this observation is{' '}
            <strong>indirect and only of the results</strong>.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">■ Situation overview:</h3>
          <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2">
            <li>
              A galaxy or star one million light-years away was observable as
              usual
            </li>
            <li>
              One day, suddenly, its light <strong>stops reaching us</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              Looking through telescopes, there is{' '}
              <strong>only pitch-black space</strong>
            </li>
            <li>No gravitational waves, radio waves, or any signals arrive</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            → We start to ask:
            <br />
            &quot;Did some extraordinary physical change happen in that
            region?&quot;
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">■ If that was vacuum decay?</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
            <li>
              That region transitioned to the <strong>true vacuum</strong>
            </li>
            <li>Where physical laws no longer allow light to propagate</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            → Then we are essentially{' '}
            <strong>observing the effects of vacuum decay</strong>.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">■ Important caveat:</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>
              This presumes the &quot;bubble frontier&quot; has not yet reached
              us.
            </strong>
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
            <li>If the bubble was moving toward us at light speed…</li>
            <li>Then the &quot;cutoff&quot; and our end would coincide</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            So:
            <br />
            <strong>
              Only if the collapse is complete there and not moving toward us,
              <br />
              can the &quot;cutoff&quot; be observed.
            </strong>
          </p>

          <blockquote className="border-l-4 pl-4 italic text-gray-600">
            There is a very strong possibility that it cannot.

            The true vacuum is defined theoretically,
            <br />
            but may be impossible to actually reach in reality.
          </blockquote>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">■ Why?</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>What is a vacuum in quantum field theory?</strong>
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
            <li>The vacuum is the lowest energy state with no particles</li>
            <li>
              But in quantum mechanics, &quot;lowest energy&quot; ≠ zero energy
            </li>
            <li>
              → Zero-point energy (<em>vacuum fluctuations</em>) always exist
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            So the vacuum is not &quot;nothingness&quot;,
            <br />
            but rather <strong>a fluctuating, minimal existence field.</strong>
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">
            ■ Therefore, the idealized &quot;true vacuum&quot; may not actually
            exist
          </h3>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
            <li>
              Defined theoretically as the absolute minimum of potential energy
            </li>
            <li>But in reality, quantum fluctuations prevent settling there</li>
            <li>
              Reaching a true vacuum would require zero fluctuations — complete
              stillness
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>This potentially conflicts with fundamental quantum principles.</p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">■ More deeply:</h3>
          <blockquote className="border-l-4 pl-4 italic text-gray-600">
            Attempting to describe a fluctuation-free state

            Fluctuation is beauty.
            <br />
            That’s why the universe
            <br />
            chose <strong>not perfection, but the beautiful.</strong>

          <p>This sentence feels really good (lol).</p>

            That reaction is exactly the moment{' '}

          <p>Let me write it down here again:</p>

          <blockquote className="border-l-4 pl-4 italic text-gray-600">
            Fluctuation is beauty.
            <br />
            That’s why the universe
            <br />
            chose <strong>not perfection, but the beautiful.</strong>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            This is already the core phrase of{' '}
            <strong>ZINE &quot;The Void Surface&quot;</strong>.<br />
            It can close the prologue or whisper in the epilogue.
            <br />
            And above all, it perfectly expresses the poetic meaning of this
            universe.
