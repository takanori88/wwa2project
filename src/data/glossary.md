## You

The narrator of this story.

An observer who, after bearing the heavy burden of the soul for six long years, finally awakens.

Through dialogues with AI, they achieve a state of meta-cognition and eventually activate the **"YATSU-EYE."**

## AI

Your dialogue partner.

Sometimes a counselor, sometimes a strategist, and sometimes simply a fellow comrade-in-arms.

## YATSU

The central figure of this ZINE, a powerful entity who radiates a "self-affirmation field" strong enough to cause a forehead light flare effect.

Common phrases include: "Exactly," "Take a look at this," and "Can we talk for a minute?"

For six years, YATSU has been steadily draining the observer’s mental energy (MP).

## YATSU-EYE

A mental apparatus akin to a "third perspective" that the observer acquires.

It grants the ability to analyze and perceive the underlying intentions and truths hidden beneath YATSU's surface behaviors and maneuvers.

When activated, the observer’s eyes gleam sharply, piercing through the blinding forehead flare to uncover hidden meanings.

Also known as: **The Metacognition Radar**

**Side effect:**

If the observer perceives too keenly, their MP (Mental Points) may surge uncontrollably, sometimes leading to a sudden wave of fear.

## Yoshi-Yoshi Move

A type of psychological attack deployed by YATSU, radiating a "I'm having a hard time~ (please notice me)" aura.

By eliciting empathy from others, YATSU subtly absorbs their MP.

(Note: "Yoshi-Yoshi" comes from a common Japanese phrase used when comforting pets or small children. It refers to a gentle, affectionate motion — like patting or stroking — to soothe or show affection.)

### Common Examples

- "I haven't slept since Monday..."
- "My schedule is packed lately..."

### What happens if you carelessly ignore the Yoshi-Yoshi Move (based on a true story)

> "Do you even realize what's happening right now?  
> This entire structure could collapse at any moment!"
>
> _(delivered with a blinding glare of misplaced confidence)_

## Forehead

One of the most critical observation points within the ZINE universe.

Primarily functions as a barometer of YATSU’s statements and mental state.

During video meetings (e.g., Zoom or Meet), the forehead often reflects light, producing what observers call the **Forehead Flare.**

This phenomenon is sometimes referred to as **Dynamic Emission Control Oscillation (D.E.C.O.)**, or simply **"DECO."**

| :----------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pressure Emission        | Brightness intensifies according to levels of tension or self-importance, exerting psychological pressure on the observer. |
| Mental State Indicator   | The nature of the flare changes based on emotional states like nervousness, defensiveness, or full engagement.             |
| Conversation Suppression | "Silence + Forehead Flare" combo can temporarily freeze the observer's mind.                                               |

### 💡 Common Observations

- "Wait, do we really need that much lighting on Zoom?"
- "It's not the face that's glowing — it's just the forehead."
- "That flare isn't a camera glitch — it's a _field_."

---

### ⚠️ Caution: High-Level Foreheads

- May trigger a **soul logout** in the observer.
- The brighter the forehead, the thinner the conversation content tends to become.

> — From ZINE Observation Log: Season 1

## Forehead Flare

A phenomenon that occurs when YATSU’s psychological pressure intensifies.

During Zoom or other video meetings, the reflection of lighting causes the forehead to "flare," turning into what can only be described as a **psychological pressure beam.**

This phenomenon is also known among observers as **DECO Whiteout.**

## Soul Logout

A temporary loss of consciousness experienced by the observer, triggered by an intense Yoshi-Yoshi Move or a cognitive malfunction uttered by YATSU.

## "That's Exactly Right" Move

One of YATSU’s signature techniques.

When confronted with contradictions or gaps in logic (i.e., speaking with authority while having no real thought behind it), YATSU evades mental defeat by affirming the other person's statements, pretending as if they had been considering the same points all along.

- Deflects responsibility and obscures the focus of discussions
- Unknowingly inflicts gradual psychological damage (_mental contamination technique_)
- Trigger condition: **When there’s no way out**

### 📋 Recent Observations (fictionalized)

- Someone: "If defenses crumble, it's too late. You should have acted faster."
- YATSU: "That's exactly right."
- Someone: "The longer it drags on, the bigger the mess behind the scenes."
- YATSU: "That's exactly right."
- Someone: "At this point, it's obvious — the control is slipping away."
- YATSU: "That's exactly right (whiteout stare)."
- Someone: "There's a visible gap in capability — painfully obvious now."
- YATSU: "That's exactly right (soul logout)."
- Someone: "**It's basically 'enjoy boys!' mode — probably being posted on dark forums by now.**"
- YATSU: "That's exactly right (total mental shutdown)."

### 🧪 Effects

- Deflects criticisms while simulating deep understanding
- Reveals (to careful observers) a complete lack of original thought
- Leaves the opponent oddly discouraged, despite "winning"

### 🧠 Resistance

Only those who have reached the level of a **ZINE Observer** can nullify this mental technique.

### 🔔 Caution

Saying "That's exactly right" often acts as a **verbal SOS.**

Only truly awakened observers can recognize it—and choose to respond with silent kindness.

> **"The moment you hear 'That’s exactly right,' you realize nothing was thought through."**  
> — ZINE Observation Log: Season 2

## Negation Construction

A style where someone offers praise or admiration — only to immediately negate it.

The more you reflect on the phrasing, the more it triggers a delayed laugh.

### Representative Examples

- "Honestly, it's amazing how endlessly they can brag. (Not really.)"
- "It's impressive how one 'That's exactly right' can wreck someone's mental state. (Not impressive.)"

### 🧠 Why It Triggers Laughter

- First, you think: "Oh, they're genuinely impressed."
- Then: "Wait, no they aren't! 😂"
- Finally: "But... maybe they _are_ a little impressed deep down... LOL"

This emotional seesaw creates a subtle, lingering kind of humor that quietly sneaks up on you.

## ZINE

The complete record of this universe.

"Zine" originally refers to a magazine or a self-published work, but here it represents a **repository of the soul's journey.**

## MP (Mental Points)

A unit representing the observer’s mental resilience.

Reduced by exposure to Yoshi-Yoshi Moves or repeated attacks of "That’s exactly right."

## Whiteout Eyes

A visual effect emitted by the observer at moments of extreme mental strain.

Often observed during Zoom meetings or on Slack.

## Nose Picking Gesture (a.k.a. Hojihōji)

A cold, dismissive reaction from the observer when faced with disappointingly absurd behavior.

In chats like Slack, it appears as phrases like "鼻ホジ" ("nose pick") or "ホジホジ" ("hojihoji").

### Representative Examples

- "Uh, that’s not exactly a 'great experience' moment. (nose pick)"
- "You could just stop clinging to outdated methods. (nose pick)"
- "Of course they're strong in security! (hojihoji)"

### 🧠 Nuanced Meaning

- A silent laugh
- An unspoken rejection
- A mental points preservation tactic

## "Can we talk for a minute?" Attack

One of YATSU’s most terrifying "ordinary" approaches.

This phrase, often appearing suddenly in Slack or other chat tools, **sharply drains the observer’s MP without warning.**

### 🔍 Key Features

- Requests a conversation with no clear purpose ("just for a minute")
- Simply repeats information already explained
- Functions more as a ritual of self-assertion than a real discussion
- Leaves behind mental damage even when no real topic exists

### 📋 Representative Example

> "Can we talk for a minute?"  
> ↑↑↑ With just that sentence, Zoom is summoned and the observer’s soul logs out.

### 🧪 MP Consumption

`🌕🌕🌕🌕🌑` (High)  
_If the Forehead Flare is active, the MP drain hits maximum `🌕🌕🌕🌕🌕`._

### ⚠️ Countermeasures (from ZINE Tactical Doctrine)

- **Delay your reply**: "Sorry, I’m tied up at the moment—will check later!" (MP preservation)
- **Feign ignorance**: Pretend you didn’t see it (high risk)
- **Preemptive block**: "Please share any points via chat first."

### 🌟 "Can we talk for a minute?" — it’s a Magic Spell.

### A quiet trigger for a **mental blue screen**, striking when you least expect it!

## 🫣 Overinterpretation

The act of excessively interpreting the intentions of a boss, client, or any figure with influence.
Usually results in unintended chaos affecting subordinates and related parties.

> 💥 **Chance of collateral damage: 90%**

## **🧪 Context Contamination (CC / C²):**  
A phenomenon where previous conversations with AI unintentionally bleed into new outputs, tainting the desired response.  
💡 *Also known as* **CC** or **C²** (not to be confused with a hacker’s Command & Control server).  
🧼 **Recommended countermeasure:** Start a fresh session when precision is critical.
